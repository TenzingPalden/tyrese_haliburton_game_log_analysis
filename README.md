### 🏀 This project explores Tyrese Haliburton’s 2024–2025 NBA season using play-by-play data from the nba_api Python library.
### 📌 It analyzes quarter-by-quarter point distribution, assist patterns, turnovers, and identifies hot streaks of made field goals in each game.

I created this project to deepen my skills in:

- Data extraction via APIs

- Data wrangling and transformation with pandas

- Time series logic and behavioral pattern recognition

- Building custom performance metrics from raw sports data

The “hot streak” detection logic uses ordered event tracking to capture momentum shifts, simulating what a coach or analyst might look for during a game.
